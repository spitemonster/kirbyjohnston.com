## I’m **Kirby**

I'm a language-agnostic full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience developing technical solutions for marketing agencies, startups and cultural institutions. Whether we’re building a new marketing website, performing code archaeology & resuscitation on a legacy platform or developing a custom eCommerce solution, I **excel** at translating business goals & requirements into a technical roadmap, implementing & communicating that roadmap and supporting my work long term.

I **love** deep dives into new languages & frameworks, collaboration with diverse teams on interesting & challenging projects and taking my time to do good work.

I **don't love** doing things the easy way if it's not the right way, unnecessarily over-complicating my work and fighting artificial deadlines.

I am currently looking for the right full-time position while selectively taking on freelance projects; you can see my history [below](/#work), learn more about me [further below](/#about) or find ways to contact me [even further below](/#contact).
