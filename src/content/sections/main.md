# Sup

**The Short Version**

I'm Kirby. I've been a full stack developer for about as long as it's been called that, primarily with marketing and CRO agencies for clients spanning local to multinational scale and for tens to thousands of users. I love solving complex problems with practical, efficient solutions and working with diverse teams to do it.

I am also a musician, mental health advocate, aspiring absurdist and traveler. I rarely but occasionally write things.

I am currently looking for work; you can see my history [below](/#work) or find ways to contact me [even further below](/#contact).
