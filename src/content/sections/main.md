# Sup.

**The Short Version**

I'm Kirby. I've been a full stack developer for longer than it's been called that, primarily with marketing and CRO agencies as the sole or primary technical contributor. I am looking for work; you can find examples of it below and ways to contact me even further below.

I am also a musician, aspiring absurdist and traveler. I rarely but occasionally write things.
