    	I’m Kirby, a polyglot software engineer and full-stack web developer with 8+ years developing technical solutions for marketing agencies, startups and cultural institutions. Whether we’re building a new marketing website, performing deep code archaeology and resuscitation on a legacy platform or architecting a new eCommerce solution, I excel at translating business goals and requirements into a technical roadmap, implementing that roadmap and supporting my work long term.

    	I am currently looking for work; you can see my history [below](/#work) or find ways to contact me [even further below](/#contact).
