## About

I had the pleasure of working with the people at Carnegie Museums numerous times, typically for a new landing page or an email template, as well as being on board for their maintenance. If you've visited this site, you've seen my work.

### Event Calendar

I was brought on to build a custom solution for a simple calendar system. Their site was old and in a precarious place at the time and there had been numerous previous plugin experiments that had gone awry, so well all felt a relatively simple custom WP plugin would suffice. This consisted of a custom post type, index page, some custom queries, and the typical scripts and styles that come with anything like this. Turnaround time and alignment with current functionality were the primary driving forces behind design and development decisions. The script building the custom query from the calendar was probably the most complicated part but this was a pretty simple and straightforward project. CSS was custom; futzing about with a library for something with this kind of turnaround seemed unnecessary, and all Javascript as usual was vanilla.
