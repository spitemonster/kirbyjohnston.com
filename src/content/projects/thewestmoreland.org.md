## About

thewestmoreland.org was one of my favorite projects working at Carney; one of the primary reasons for which is its very neat and elegant design. i loved working with the other developers to align our code and the designers tweaking UI details. My responsibilities included back end customizations and several UI components built using ACF and Bootstrap, including but not limited to:

### Homepage Hero

### Main Navigation

In retrospect I would have put more work into smoothing the image-loading so it didn't happen in front of the user.

### Accordion

I've since become far more focused on an accessible experience than I was when I made this accordion. I believe this is the last accordion that I built _not_ using `<details>` elements. I like the smooth animations and the designers did too but. I also am not certain why I made some of the semantic decisions that I did, and in retrospect now regret.
