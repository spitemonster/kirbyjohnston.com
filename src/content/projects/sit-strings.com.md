## About

SIT Strings is a really rad company based in Akron, Ohio and their site was one of the first (and longest running) projects I received at Carney. I can personally attest to the quality of their strings; not my daily drivers but they did stay in tune! My role was to come in, finish up any components that had not been completed as well as any other dev work to get it across the finish line. All-in-all it is a fairly straightforward, if very stylized, ecom website. Like most Carney projects, this is built on an in-house base theme focused on ACF and uses Bootstrap utility styles. The Dealers component is partially React based, however.
