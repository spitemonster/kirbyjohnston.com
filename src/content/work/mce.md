summary: 'Working as the sole architect and primary developer with a team of 1.25 on a very tight timeline, I was able to build an entirely fresh Shopify theme and a new CSS library to go with it and deliver a hugely performant project, not only on time but with days to spare, that exceeded client goals regarding site and sales performance post-launch.'
