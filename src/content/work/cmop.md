client_name: carnegiemuseums.org
platform: Wordpress
url: https://carnegiemuseums.org
summary: While the project was completed a while before I joined the team, I was given the keys to maintenance and client requests, including the Events section of the site which was built custom after determining that plugin solutions were either too expensive or too heavilty featured. My frequent work with the client developed into a strong client relationship.
