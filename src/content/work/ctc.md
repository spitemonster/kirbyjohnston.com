summary: Working as the lead developer, we were tasked with adapting a client's Shopify theme to new designs. Unable to fully rebuild anything, my focus was on developing a keen understanding of the current theme and adapting both old and new content blocks to use the theme's content structure while improving overall performance and usability.
