                Iâ€™m Kirby Johnston, a Web and Software Engineer with almost a
                decade of experience working primarily with marketing agencies.
                In this work Iâ€™ve honed a diverse set of skills that span the
                full development lifecycle, from ideation through developent and
                into launch and support. My work is driven by a practical
                approach to development and an obsession with understanding how
                things work from the bottom up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career I've cultivated experience and expertise in
                a variety of programming languages, frameworks and concepts, a
                flexibility which has been essential for the diverse projects to
                which I've been attached. As with any of my contemporaries, I
                carry a profound love for Javascript, its flexibility and its
                frameworks, primarily with Vue and Svelte on the front end and
                Express on the back.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach and philosophy has allowed me to deliver thorough,
                lasting and performant solutions and build strong relationships
                with clients throughout a number of platforms, including
                Wordpress, Shopify, Vercel, Webflow and many others.

                        Working as the sole architect and primary developer with
                        a team of 1.25 on a very tight timeline, I was able to
                        build an entirely fresh Shopify theme and a new CSS
                        library to go with it and deliver a hugely performant
                        project, not only on time but with days to spare, that
                        exceeded client goals regarding site and sales
                        performance post-launch.

                        Working as the lead developer, we were tasked with
                        adapting a client's Shopify theme to new designs. Unable
                        to fully rebuild anything, my focus was on developing a
                        keen understanding of the current theme and adapting
                        both old and new content blocks to use the theme's
                        content structure while improving overall performance
                        and usability.

                        Working as one of several developers on this project, my
                        goals and achievements were to keep code in line with
                        the team's standard and provide an overall performance
                        audit before launch as well as perform ongoing
                        maintenance and updates.

                        While the project was completed a while before I joined
                        the team, I was given the keys to maintenance and client
                        requests, including the Events section of the site which
                        was built custom after determining that plugin solutions
                        were either too expensive or too heavilty featured. My
                        frequent work with the client developed into a strong
                        client relationship.
